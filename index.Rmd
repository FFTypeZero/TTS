# Preface

Welcome to Introduction to Time Series using `R`!


$\var (x)$

## A foreword

This book was designed for use in STAT 429, Time Series Analysis,
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. When possible, it would be
best to always access the text online to be sure you are using the latest
version. The online version affords additional features over the
traditional PDF copy such as a scaling text, variety of font faces, and
themed backgrounds. However, if you are in need of a local copy, 
a [**pdf version** is also available](http://its.thecoatlessprofessor.com/its.pdf).

**Disclaimer:** This book is under active development. As a result, errors 
may occur that range in severity from typos to broken code. If any of these 
issues arise, there are two options:

1. If you are familiar with GitHub and know RMarkdown,
[make a pull request and fix the issue yourself!](https://github.com/coatless/its) (fastest resolution)
     - In the Online version, click the edit button in the top-left corner.

2. Send an email to `balamut2 AT illinois DOT edu` and we will address issue.

##  Rendering Mathematical Formulae

Throughout the book, there will be mathematical symbols used to express the
material. Depending on the version of the book, there are two different render
engines. 

- For the online version, the text uses [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
to render mathematical notation for the web. In the event the formulae does
not load for a specific chapter, first try to refresh the page. 9 times out of
10 the issue is related to the software library not loading quickly.
- For the pdf version, the text is built using the recommended AMS LaTeX 
symbolic packages. As a result, there should be no issue displaying equations.

An example of a mathematical rendering capabilities would be given as:

\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \]

##  Mathematical Notation

The following notation will be adopted throughout the book.

* $X$ denotes a (continuous) RV.
* $X_t$ is $X$ at time $t \in N$.
* $E\left(X_t\right)$ is the Mean of $X$ at time $t$.
* $Var\left(X_t\right)$ is the Variance of $X$ at time $t$.
* $X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{k}$ are sequence of random variables.
* $f\left(x\right)$ denotes the density function of $X$ and $f\left(x, y\right)$
denotes the joint density function of $x$ and $Y$.
* $\left(X_t\right)_{t=1,\ldots,T} := \left(X_t\right) := (X_1, \ldots, X_T)$.

## R Code Conventions

The code used throughout the book will predominately be `R` code.  
To obtain a copy of [`R`](https://cloud.r-project.org/), go to the
[Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.

When `R` code is displayed it will be typeset using a `monospace` font with 
syntax highlighting enabled to ensure the differentiation of functions,
variables, and so on. For example, the following adds 1 to 1

```{r, eval = FALSE}
a = 1L + 1L
a
```

Each code segment may contain actual output from `R`. Such output will appear
in grey font prefixed by `##`. For example, the output of the above code
segment would look like so:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
a = 1L + 1L
a
```

Alongside the PDF download of the book, you should find the R code used within 
each chapter.
