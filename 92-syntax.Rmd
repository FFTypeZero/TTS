# Remark on Syntax 

Hi guys, since we are all using a different syntax here is what I propose. Let me know if we should change it. Once we agree, we will unify the syntax:

| Symbol              |  Meaning              |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| $\e{ }$             |  Expected value       |
| $\var$              |  Variance             |
| $\cov$              |  Covariance           |
| $\corr$             |  Correlation          |
| $\ind$              |  Indicator            |
| $\real$             |  Real                 |
| $\natural$          |  Natural              |
| $\integers$         |  Integers             |
| $(X_t)$             |  A time series        |
| $\{X_t\}$           |  A set                |
| $\gamma()$          |  Autocov. fun.        |
| $\rho()$            |  Autocor. fun.        |
| $W_t$               |  White noise          |
| $\normal$           |  Normal dist.         |
| $\KL$               |  KL diverg.           |
| $n$                 |  Length of time series|


Also for the parenthesis, I propose to use this as much as possible $\{[(\{[( \cdot )]\})]\}$, for which I am a terrible example.
