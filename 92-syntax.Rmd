# Remark on Syntax 

Hi guys, since we are all using a different syntax here is what I propose. Let me know if we should change it. Once we agree, we will unify the syntax:

|                     |                  |
|---------------------|------------------|
| $\mathbb{E} []$     |  Expected value  |
| $\var$              |  variance        |
| $\cov$              |  covariance      |
| $\corr$             |  correlation     |
| $\boldsymbol{1}$    |  indicator       |
| $\real$             |  real            |
| $\natural$          |  natural         |
| $\integers$         |  integers        |
| $(X_t)$             |  a time series   |
| $\{X_t\}$           |  a set           |
| $\gamma()$          |  autocov. fun.   |
| $\rho()$            |  autocor. fun.   |
| $W_t$               |  white noise     |


Also for the parenthesis, I propose to use as much as possible $\{[(\{[( \cdot )]\})]\}$
